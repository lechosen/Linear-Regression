# Linear-Regression
Given a dataset contains 13750 instances with a set of 40 features (Input)describing the airplane's status. The goal is to use these features to predict a command (continuous variable) that our controller should issue.

Implement three different types of gradient descent algorithm: 1. Full batch Gradient 2. Mini-batch 3. Stochastic Gradient Descent
